This evaluation makes it possible to carry out a complete and precise analysis of the professional profile of the employee evaluated in order to define a tailor-made progress and/or development plan. The analysis covers both the know-how and the interpersonal skills of employees. The assessment may, among other things, focus on managerial skills, communication skills, decision-making skills, management of responsibilities, etc.'
